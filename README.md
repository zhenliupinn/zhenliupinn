# zhenliupinn

**zhenliupinn** is an open-source platform for pre-stack AVO inversion, building a comprehensive family of physics-informed neural network (PINN) solutions. This project aims to drive next-generation geophysical inversion and reservoir characterization by integrating physics, AI, and Bayesian uncertainty modeling.

## Key Architectures Included

- **CNN-PINN:** Classic convolutional PINN framework.
- **CNN-BiLSTM-PINN:** Sequence modeling enhanced PINN.
- **iPINN:** PINN with learnable wavelet frequency (implicit PINN).
- **BPINN:** Bayesian PINN for uncertainty quantification.
- **iBPINN:** Frequency-adaptive Bayesian PINN.
- **BPI‑ViT:** Bayesian Physics-Informed Vision Transformer — the flagship model, enabling structure-level uncertainty quantification and attention-based interpretability (https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7097139/v2).
- **Future Extensions:** More advanced and innovative PINN-based methods are under development.

> This repository is under active development.  
> **Stay tuned — BPI‑ViT and the full PINN ecosystem will be released soon!**
